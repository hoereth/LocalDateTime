# LocalDateTime

## Description

This package introduces a real local date/time data type to iOS. It is based on DateComponents for easy converting between Date and LocalDateTime. Technically, a LocalDateTime is just wrapping a DateComponents object. However, it asserts that year, month, day, hour, minute and second components are always set.
